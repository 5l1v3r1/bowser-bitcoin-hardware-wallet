<h1>BOWSER, DIY BITCOIN HARDWARE WALLET (BETA)</h1>

DIY hardware wallet hidden behind a decoy game. Obviously use with caution.

Building your own hardware wallet is a bit like building a lightsaber, only really necessary if you want to be a Jedi.

Now building hardware wallets is easy with the help of <a href="https://github.com/micro-bitcoin/uBitcoin">uBitcoin</a> an Arduino library created by Stepan Snigrev.

Building hardware wallets not only gives greater autonomy/liberty, it is a great excuse to get a deeper understanding of bitcoin how bitcoin keys, seeds and signing works.
