<h1>BOWSER, DIY BITCOIN HARDWARE WALLET (BETA)</h1>

DIY hardwarew wallet hidden behind a decoy game. Obviosuely use with caution.
We understand the importance of building our own nodes, yet we dont give the same emphasis to buidling hardware wallets?!
I suppose building your own harware wallet is a bit like building a lihght saber, only really nessesary if you want to be a jedi.
